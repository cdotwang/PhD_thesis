= Phase diagram of tetrahedra and octahedra

In this chapter, we present the phase diagram of a binary mixture of hard tetrahedra and octahedra, which self-assembles into a space-tessellating structure. This structure is composed of alternating layers of octahedra and tetrahedra, forming a binary crystal with the same stoichiometry as the ideal space-filling structure. We show that this binary crystal forms at a wide range of compositions and pressures.
